# Match Serious

The goal of this 2d mobile video game is to demonstrate how a large game development studio is addressing employees fatigue by creating an employee Fatigue Monitoring Game. This game was created to monitor and measure employee fatigue levels by putting them through a series of mental tasks such as response time challenges, memory tests, focus and attention tests, and decision-making situations. These exercises measure important variables such as attention and reaction time, helping in detecting signs of Fatigue.

These exercises measure important variables such as attention and reaction time, helping in detecting signs of Fatigue.

1.	Monitor Fatigue: Track employees' fatigue levels in a fun and engaging way through various reaction-based tasks, such as reaction time challenges, memory tests, focus and attention tasks, and decision-making scenarios.

2.	Prevent workplace stress: Identify signs of fatigue early by collecting and analyzing performance metrics, such as reaction time, accuracy, errors made, and completion time, and by calculating a fatigue score.

3.	Improve Workplace Productivity: Create a better work environment by giving a tool that helps in mental ability to concentrate, ultimately increasing overall productivity.

4.	Promote Well-Being: Encourage employees to take breaks and properly manage their workload by continuously changing task difficulty depending on performance.
