# Match Serious

The goal of this 2d mobile video game is to demonstrate how a large game development studio is addressing employees fatigue by creating an employee Fatigue Monitoring Game. This game was created to monitor and measure employee fatigue levels by putting them through a series of mental tasks such as response time challenges, memory tests, focus and attention tests, and decision-making situations. These exercises measure important variables such as attention and reaction time, helping in detecting signs of Fatigue.
